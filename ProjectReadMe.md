## State of Development

A number of people identified as members of the frontend team where asked to come up with Wireframes / mockups of how the site should function. 

The purpose of this was to generate visual representation of the project ideas in its most simplistic form.

During the sprints rough sketches were generated, and can be found in the link below.


The purpose of this is to provide visual cues and iterate until an agreeable design that suites the specification and usability of the project is met.


This is usually referred to as the soil watering stage, as the next stage of development will be one where actual seeds are planted ie; Actual coding. Hehe hope you like my parlance?

This process will happen simultaneously in 2 teams, namely; 

Backend, FrontEnd.


### Backend;
The Backend shall be fully involved in the development of all things back-end, including but not limited to Routes, controllers, models, DB migrations,  etc.

### Frontend;

The Frontend team just like their name shall be fully involved with all things front-end, making use of existing frameworks as they create the look and feel of the site making use of Dummy data until completion of backend Apis by backend team.

## Current State of Development

The process is iterative and highly collaborative, as any body's input can influence the direction of the project during the development, so inputs and ideas are highly welcomed.

As a DSC lead, please associate with a team and start hacking away. 
Project is easy to start and flow with. Just make your very best contribution, learn new things, if you can (Highly recommended). 

With Love.
